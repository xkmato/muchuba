=======

This is project code name muchuba

So what you are going to do is download and install a module called easy_install

Below are the commands you'll run after you've installed the app.

 -  pip install South

Ok that is basically all. If pip does not work run "easy_install install South"

The rest of the stuff I will do. But meanwhile look at this link below, It should be able to give you a clear picture.
